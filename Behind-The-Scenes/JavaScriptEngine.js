// 1) Compliation (portable file) --  converts code to machine code and writes i
// into a binary file that will be executed

// 2) Interpreter -- Excutes code line by line, needs to convert
// code to machine code

// JIT (JUST-IN-TIME) (no portable file)-- Code gets converted to machine code at once
// then get executed
