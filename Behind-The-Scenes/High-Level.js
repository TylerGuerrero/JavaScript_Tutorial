// High Level -- Does not have to deal with memory, has a garbage collection

// Garbage Collection -- cleans up the memory leak

// Interpreted -- it compiles just in time

// Multi-paradigm -- 1) procedural, 2) Object Oriented, 3) functional

// first class functions -- functions can be treated like variables,
                            // can pass them into other functions


// Dynamic -- no data types, can change data types

// **
// Single-Threaded-- can only run one thing at a time
// it will take long running tasks execute them in the background
// then put them back in the main thread
